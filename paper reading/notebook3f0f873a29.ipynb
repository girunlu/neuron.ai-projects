You can also use `weights=ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.\n","  warnings.warn(msg)\n","Downloading: \"https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\n","100%|██████████| 44.7M/44.7M [00:00<00:00, 153MB/s] \n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Epoch 0/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.7345 Acc: 0.7672\n","test Loss: 0.4644 Acc: 0.8336\n","\n","Epoch 1/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.4640 Acc: 0.8339\n","test Loss: 0.4305 Acc: 0.8423\n","\n","Epoch 2/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.4321 Acc: 0.8431\n","test Loss: 0.4006 Acc: 0.8534\n","\n","Epoch 3/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.4129 Acc: 0.8485\n","test Loss: 0.3956 Acc: 0.8547\n","\n","Epoch 4/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.4003 Acc: 0.8522\n","test Loss: 0.3734 Acc: 0.8615\n","\n","Epoch 5/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3909 Acc: 0.8553\n","test Loss: 0.3792 Acc: 0.8587\n","\n","Epoch 6/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3836 Acc: 0.8572\n","test Loss: 0.3793 Acc: 0.8607\n","\n","Epoch 7/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3772 Acc: 0.8598\n","test Loss: 0.3813 Acc: 0.8597\n","\n","Epoch 8/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3720 Acc: 0.8607\n","test Loss: 0.3678 Acc: 0.8626\n","\n","Epoch 9/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3672 Acc: 0.8624\n","test Loss: 0.3670 Acc: 0.8635\n","\n","Epoch 10/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3390 Acc: 0.8715\n","test Loss: 0.3473 Acc: 0.8695\n","\n","Epoch 11/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3329 Acc: 0.8736\n","test Loss: 0.3472 Acc: 0.8692\n","\n","Epoch 12/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3306 Acc: 0.8743\n","test Loss: 0.3493 Acc: 0.8688\n","\n","Epoch 13/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3278 Acc: 0.8750\n","test Loss: 0.3448 Acc: 0.8710\n","\n","Epoch 14/14\n","----------\n","train Loss: 0.3268 Acc: 0.8753\n","test Loss: 0.3465 Acc: 0.8692\n","\n","Training complete in 238m 55s\n","Best val Acc: 0.000000\n"]}],"source":["model = start_train(models.resnet18(pretrained=True), emi_byc_class, emi_byc_train, emi_byc_test, \"emni\", BackData = back_gray_emi, back_info = True, lrate=0.1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":4020430,"sourceId":6994596,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30588,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
